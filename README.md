# Overview

The goal of this assessment is to create a form using React but not in the standard way. The goal is to collect user information in a fun and interactive way.

Check out https://current.com/mrbeast/ and see the second slide with the chat bubbles. See screenshot attached. Consider this the template in which you will have the user interact (like a chatbot, but with only a handful of questions).

# Required operations

1. Create a user experience that they will use to submit their info
 - We want to collect their name, email, the product their interested in ['individual', 'parent', 'teen'], and an optional message
 - Emulate an interactive chat bot experience validating user responses along the way
 - Make this mobile responsive
 - Use CSS animations to animate the responses
 - Feel free to use any libraries and to pull assets from the live page itself!

2. Deploy and share!

# Bonus operations

1. Use query params to pre-fill inputs and advance in state providing a summary to verify
2. Create a way to go back to previous steps to redo responses
3. Add easter eggs

# Delivery

Please make sure the link to your deployed site is provided in the README.
